Newzope
=======

This is the newzope "instance manager" for Plone, aimed at providing rapid prototyping ability for those who like to fiddle. If you don't like to fiddle, you should probably `use buildout <https://buildout.org>`_.

Installation
------------

Assuming you have Zope and Plone installed already:

::

    python setup.py install

Usage
-----

See ``newzope -h`` for more information.
