Newzope
=======

This is the newzope "instance manager" for Plone, aimed at providing rapid prototyping ability for those who like to fiddle. It assumes you have Zope and Plone installed already.

If you don't like to fiddle, you should `use buildout <https://buildout.org>`_.

See ``newzope -h`` for more information.

Installation
------------

::

    python setup.py install
